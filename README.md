# Hi, I'm Patryk ðŸ™Œ

## About me
I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology. 

I specialize in C++, Python programming languages and backend technologies. I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity and computer networks. My interests also include AI, game development and low-level programming.

Previously I've gained experience in developing and maintainging Windows drivers for network interface cards. Through my university I greatly increased my abilities in Java SDK (Spring library).
